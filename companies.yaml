    location: "Stripe Chicago 515 N State St, Chicago, Illinois 60610, US"
    job_description: "About the job Who we are About Stripe Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies - from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups - use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone's reach while doing the most important work of your career. About The Team Stripe is beloved by developers for the simplicity of our APIs, the thoroughness of our documentation, and our focus on developer experience. The Technical Solutions Engineering (TSE) team is the glue that supports our developer-users and champions developer experience as being central to the overall experience of our users. TSE interacts directly with developer-users more than any other team at Stripe, so your role will have a significant impact on what Stripe is known for and values most. When we do our job well, developers all over the world are able to smoothly launch and grow their businesses on Stripe, whether they’re integrating payments for the first time or building complex financial systems. What you’ll do TSEs understand the fundamentals of programming incredibly well and eagerly jump in and familiarize themselves with others’ code. You will do a wide variety of things, including explaining technical concepts about Stripe’s products, build and debug integrations with developers, and produce/improve guides that help our users solve particular problems to be successful with Stripe. You will interact with developers of all skill levels through a variety of mediums, enabling them to be successful when using Stripe. Early on, current team members will devote a large amount of time to teaching you and helping you get to a level of comfort and expertise with Stripe, its services, and how we interact with users. Later, we’d love for you to take on this role with others on the team and Stripes broadly, as teaching is a great way to learn and to reinforce what you know. If you’re someone who enjoys working with all kinds of code, is a fast researcher, a strong writer, and enthusiastic about helping others build mission-critical products with Stripe, we want to hear from you! Responsibilities Communicate with a number of external developers and aid them in building their applications against Stripe’s infrastructure in a number of programming languages (including Java, Python, Ruby, PHP, Go, NodeJS, .NET, ReactJS, React Native, Swift, Objective-C, Kotlin, and Java for Android). Unblock external developers with their thorniest integration challenges through a variety of support channels including email, ticketing software, internal issue trackers, community platforms (like StackOverflow), and real-time chat software (like Slack and Discord) Develop and maintain internal and external documentation, examples, integration demos, and code-snippets that demonstrate usage patterns of the Stripe infrastructure. Identify points of friction developers encounter and collaborate with engineering teams to make Stripe products better. Participate in a number of extended engineering teams’ regular planning sessions, design reviews, and development meetings. Develop and maintain a suite of internal support tooling for TSE and Stripe Support more broadly e.g. a retrieval augmented generation LLM-based Copilot tool or the Invoice Explainer Admin tool. Act as a developer advocate and educational resource internal to the organization by regularly assembling training for non-developers internal to the organization and responding in real-time to product integration questions. Who you are We're looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement. Minimum Requirements At least 4 years of full-stack software development experience, with a proven track record of building web or mobile applications that deliver high-quality user experiences Direct experience explaining technical concepts, and would be comfortable explaining how Stripe works to both technical and non-technical audiences Understands how to write good, clean code in multiple programming languages, as well as how to read code that might not be quite as well written Ability to help users during working hours in the region you are in. This may occasionally include providing weekend coverage for monitoring/supporting critical infrastructure, which TSEs are uniquely equipped to assist with given the team’s knowledge around Stripe’s products and active integrations. The team is largely remote, and we are very supportive of working arrangements that allow for family care and other needs to be met. Preferred Qualifications Enjoys writing in a clear and quick manner General software engineering skills are important to us, as we understand that new languages and frameworks can be learned if you understand the concepts Experience teaching or coaching developers Comfort working with a great deal of autonomy and limited supervision Degree in Computer Science, Software/Computer Engineering, or a related analytical field of study We are seeking coverage for the Central Time Zone and are happy to consider remote candidates throughout the U.S., in addition to those based in Chicago. Hybrid work at Stripe This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).  Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams. A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live. Pay and benefits The annual US base salary range for this role is $131,600 - $197,400. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (\"OTE\") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process. Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends."
